    India, officially the Republic of India (ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest 
    country by area, the most populous country in the world, and the most populous democracy. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on 
    the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the 
    west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the 
    vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and 
    Indonesia.

    Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago. Their long occupation, 
    initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human 
    genetic diversity. Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago,
    evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, 
    an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest. Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the 
    Rigveda. Preserved by a resolutely vigilant oral tradition, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.

    In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western coasts.
    Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains, eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern
    India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam. In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture 
    in south India. In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion. The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative 
    peace, leaving a legacy of luminous architecture. Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial e
    conomy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.

    British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly, but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education 
    and the public life took root. A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending 
    British rule. In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions, a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority 
    Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.
