        The Chera dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala. 
        The Ay kingdom in the deep south and the Ezhimala kingdom in the north formed the other kingdoms in the early years 
        of the Common Era (CE). The region had been a prominent spice exporter since 3000 BCE. The region's prominence in trade was
        noted in the works of Pliny as well as the Periplus around 100 CE. In the 15th century, the spice trade attracted Portuguese 
        traders to Kerala, and paved the way for European colonisation of India. At the time of Indian independence movement in the 
        early 20th century, there were two major princely states in Kerala: Travancore and Cochin. They united to form the state of 
        Thiru-Kochi in 1949. The Malabar region, in the northern part of Kerala, had been a part of the Madras province of British India, which later became a part of the Madras State post-independence. After the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, the modern-day state of Kerala was formed by merging the Malabar district of Madras State (excluding Gudalur taluk of Nilgiris district, Lakshadweep Islands, Topslip, the Attappadi Forest east of Anakatti), the taluk of Kasaragod (now Kasaragod District) in South Canara, and the erstwhile state of Thiru-Kochi (excluding four southern taluks of Kanyakumari district, and Shenkottai taluks)
