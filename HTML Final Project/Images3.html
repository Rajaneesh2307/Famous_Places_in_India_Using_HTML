        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Munnar</h2>
        <p style="padding: 18px; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.3; padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">
        Munnar rises as three mountain streams merge  - Mudrapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundala. 1,600 m above sea level, 
        this hill station was once the summer resort of the erstwhile British Government in South India. One of the most sought 
        after honeymoon destinations in Kerala, Munnar is replete with resorts and lodging facilities that fit a wide rage of budgets. 
        Sprawling tea plantations, picturesque towns, winding lanes and holiday facilities make this a popular resort town. Among the exotic flora found in the forests and grasslands here is the Neelakurinji. This flower which bathes the hills in blue once in every twelve years, will bloom next in 2030. Munnar also has the highest peak in South India, Anamudi, which towers over 2,695 m.

        One of the main attractions near Munnar is the Eravikulam National Park. This park is famous for its endangered inhabitant - the 
        Nilgiri Tahr. Spread over an area of 97 sq. km., this park is also home to several species of rare butterflies, animals and 
        birds. A great place for trekking, the park offers a magnificent view of the tea plantations caressed by blankets of mists. 
        The park becomes a hot destination when the hill slopes here get covered in a carpet of blue, resulting from the flowering of 
        the Neelakurinji. It is a plant endemic to this part of the Western Ghats which blooms once in twelve years.
