        Hampi, the city of ruins, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Situated in the shadowed depth of hills and valleys in the state of 
        Karnataka, this place is a historical delight for travellers. Surrounded by 500 ancient monuments, beautiful temples, 
        bustling street markets, bastions, treasury building and captivating remains of Vijayanagar Empire, Hampi is a backpacker's 
        delight. Hampi is an open museum with 100+ locations to explore and a favourite way to see the city from the perspective of its history.

        Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagar empire around 1500 AD, and by some accounts, the second largest city 
        in the world at that time. Over the next centuries it fell out of importance, and now you can explore the ruins of a lot 
        of temples and other structures spread out over a vast area. The terrain around Hampi is as mysterious as the ruins itself - 
        the city is surrounded by boulders of different sizes, and you can climb to the top of them with a little effort to get a stunning view of the entire city and the geography. It is located on the banks of the Tungabhadra River.
